## Introduction

I'm a committed tech enthusiast with a background in Maths and Computing. After some exposure to coding during my degree, I decided to join Makers Academy Bootcamp in December 2021 to gain real-world insight into software development. With experience in Test-Driven Development and Agile workflows, I'm a team player who enjoys contributing to large projects and continuous improvement.

## Skills

### Problem Solving

- With a naturally inquisitive mine. Problem solving is a key skill I used at makers. Whilst on the final project the team was having issues when merging pull requests. After further investigation I was able to identify that the team was using a mix of yarn and npm. After highlighting the issue I suggested that to resolve the issue as a collective we should make amendments where there was no consistency and go forward using the same package manager. 

### Leadership 

- During my first project at Makers, I was introduced to the idea of using a different team lead every day for a group project by one of my cohort members. I embraced this opportunity to act as a Team Lead by making sure I was well prepared and fully aware of the project overview and objectives, as well as encouraged the use of agile methodologies. 
- Going forward in my following projects with new teams, I recommended this approach and volunteered to lead first as everyone was understandably a bit apprehensive of taking charge as we are all peers. I also noted things I admired from my peer's leadership styles and tried to implement them into my strategy. 

### Team Player
 - I am an adept team player who has worked in countless teams whether that be as part of a university, my previous roles and Makers Academy. Therefore as a good team player, I've always ensured that any work I've done has been finished on time and kept to the project schedule. This was documented and evidenced at makers on my final project using Jira where I completed my team and individual tickets in the required time.
