## Introduction

A committed, hard-working tech enthusiast with an eagerness to learn new things, further enhanced by my education at the Makers Academy Bootcamp. Key concepts such as keeping to a strict Test Driven Development and being able to follow an Agile workflow. A team player who is well versed in working on large projects and producing ideas for continuous improvement, as well as taking on personal responsibilities when it comes to learning new material.

I had some exposure to coding when it came to my degree. I Studied Maths and Computing and I always knew it was a viable career path, but never really considered it. Being able to design things like websites or apps with nothing more than a keyboard, mouse and your imagination was a skill that I really wanted to learn.

The pandemic came around and I decided that I wanted to pick up coding again, and I really enjoyed to the point that I was starting to create little side projects. I knew to get a real foothold into the tech industry and gain some real insight into how working in tech would look like I would have to join a coding bootcamp. Makers Academy is highly selective of its bootcamp students so it was an honour to be selected for the December 2021 cohort. I completed a Ruby course on Code Academy and got stuck into Codewars katas which I'm still doing regularly to keep myself sharp during my job search. It's also really helped when it came to making sure I had the fundamentals on point because syntax aside without knowing what the code in front of you is doing coding can get really hard. Have a look below for what I've been getting up to my during my 3 months at Makers.

## Skills

### Problem Solving

- My experience in the customer service, and my background in Maths and Computing has led me to always have an inquisitive mind. It also gave me a lot fo opportunities to problem solve.
- Makers Academy enhanced my thirst to problem solve as I soon came to a realisation that problem solving is the continuous theme when it comes anything technical. Test driven development is a concept that I've grown to lvoe and be very comfortable. To be able to build anything of note, problems and errors must be overcome and resolved. That way you know whatever you've built has survived the highs and lows. When it comes to coding in general I never tire of solving these problems and it is the main driver in me being so passionate about tech and wanting to increase my knowledge of software. 

### Team Player
 - I am an adept team player who has worked in countless teams whether that be as part of university, my previous roles and Makers Academy. Working as part of a team gives you that heightened sense of responsibility, because if you don't get the work that you are meant to, you're not only letting yourself down you're also letting your team down. Therefore as a good team player, I've always ensured that any work I've done has been finished on time and kept to the project schedule.
 - This ability and awareness was very useful during the group projects while studing at Makers Academy. I worked on the backend and the frontend and was able to see how one relied on the other when it came to functionality of the project. Therefore I was able to stick to our predetermined project schedule and even assist other team members get their deliverables over the line to ensure we never missed our deadlines.

Languages - Ruby (Sinatra, Rails, Capybara, RSpec), JavaScript (React, Node, Express, Jest), PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Command Line.
